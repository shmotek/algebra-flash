# Algebra Addition Flash Tool

This project is an interactive teaching tool I developed while teaching high school algebra. It was designed to help students model basic addition of integers by allowing them to drag various values onto the stage and see if they can correctly guess the sum. The answer can either be visible or invisible.

## How It Works

Students can drag different values onto the stage from the following options:

- +1
- -1
- +5
- -5
- +10
- -10

As they drag the values, they can make guesses about the resulting sum. This helps reinforce the concepts of positive and negative numbers as well as addition.

## Files

- **`modeling_addition.fla`** – The original Flash source file used to create the tool.
- **`modeling_addition.swf`** – The compiled interactive tool that can be used in a browser with Flash support.

## Future Development

This tool was originally part of a larger suite of teaching tools aimed at making algebra more interactive and engaging for students. While Flash is no longer widely supported, the project remains available for educational purposes and future development.
